      <p>Get ready for some Halloween fun times. Where's the party? Oh it's out here. Come to the craziest Halloween party you've ever seen. Maybe some ghouls and goblins will be there. I don't know, it's Halloween.</p>

      <p>I definitely know who won't be there... you. Unless, of course, you are. In which case, you won't miss out on the best Halloween party in existence. So, you know, you better be there. Be there or be square, and not just for Halloween, for the other 364 days of the year as well. That's what I always say.</p>
